# Machine-Learning-Projects
This repository contains a collection of machine learning projects.

1. **Books-Classifier**
   - Use XGBoost to classify books.
  

2. **GBDT-XGBoost-LightGBM**
   - Use XGBoost and LightGBM to predict whether a bicycle has a fault.
   
   
3. **SVM-KNN-DT-RF-LR-NB-AdaBoost-Ensemble**

    This folder contains implementations of several key machine learning algorithms and an ensemble method that combines these models. 

	- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
	- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
	- Decision Tree (DT)
	- Random Forest (RF)
	- Logistic Regression (LR)
	- Naive Bayes (NB)
	- Adaptive Boosting (AdaBoost)
	- Ensemble
